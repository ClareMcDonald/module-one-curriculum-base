## Presentation Guidelines

Shoot for 20 minutes per team.

### General notes
- Be positive. 
- You __are not__ here to showcase how smart you are. 
- You __are__ here to show to prospective employers _how fun it is to have you on a team_.
- Give credit. Congratulate your teammates on their contributions.

### Intros
- Each teammate says their name and hi
- Perhaps everybody delivers some domain specific tidbit to set the tone.
  - If it's a cooking app, maybe tell the audience your favorite recipe. If it's a chess app, maybe tell the audience a chess factoid.
- Traditionally, you say 'and I'm a software developer' or whatever. Not sure if that's a great idea, but it's what everybody does ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Product talk (~6 minutes)
- Typically, a single team member speaks during this entire section. A second team member screen shares and drives through the app.
- Non-technical. No code. Target audience is product managers and other stakeholders.
- Show only deployed work. No localhost.
- Take users on a tour of your app, perhaps role-playing as a potential user
- Explain the value this app creates, problems it solves
- Briefly showcase major features by using the app
- Practice the 'golden path'
- Invite audience to use the app.

### Tech talk (~10 minutes)
- Technical details. Show code and assume an audience of developers.
- Do not read code aloud. Tell the story of your app through code. 
   - Nobody wants to hear you read your `for` loop out loud.
- Keep one driver throughout. However, every member of the group will speak, one by one.
- Each team member selects one feature, one file, or one interesting function and presents on it.
  - Briefly remind the audience how the feature looks in the app.
  - Show the code and describe in general terms why it's interesting.
  - What problems did you run into?
  - What did you learn?
  - What advice do you have for anybody else facing this task?

### Conclusion
- What did you like about working with this group?
- 
### Questions (~3 minutes)
- Prepare for:
  - If you had one more week, what would you have added?
  - What was the most interesting bug you ran into?
  - What was your favorite part about this week?
- "We chose focus our efforts elsewhere"
- No snowing.
