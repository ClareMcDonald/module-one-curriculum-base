# Module 3 - Simple State and Event Listeners

## Query Selector 

```js
// these two statements are exactly the same
const myDiv = document.getElementById('my-div');
const myDiv = document.querySelectors('#my-div');
```

## Functions for Reused Code

There are two kinds of functions:

### Pure Functions

```js
// pure functions are super predictable
// if you pass the same input twice, you will get the same output twice
// all pure functions have return statements
function add(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2
}

// because this function has a return statement, we can store (in a variable) whatever result it 'spits out'.
const sum = add(5, 6);
```

### Impure Functions

```js
// notice that this variable is defined _outside the function declaration_
const coolDivFromHTML = document.querySelector('#my-divs)

function mutateCoolDiv(words) {
    // üí• impure function alert üí•
    // this function mutates something defined _outside the function declaration_
    coolDivFromHTML.textContent = words;

    // üí• impure function alert üí•
    // no return statement!
}
```


```js
function getRandomNumberBetween0And10(/*üí• impure function alert üí• no arguments! */) {
    // üí• impure function alert üí•
    // randomness! no way to predict this
    return Math.random() * 10
}
```

Question: What do you think is easier to test: pure or impure functions? Why?

## Random numbers

```js
// get a random number between 1 and 10
const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);

// you could use this random number as an array index. Why would we want to do that?
myArray[randomNumber] 
```


## State and View

State is the whole point of apps.

State is anything that changes over time.

Every time state changes, update the DOM to show the user what the new state is.

In plain JS, state is usually stored in `let` variables. 

Why do you think that is?

```js
let counter = 0;

counter++
```

## Click handlers

```js
const button = document.querySelector('#my-button');

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    // üòé Cool Zone üòé
    // when you click the #my-button button, whatever code you write in the cool zone will execute 

    // (the cool zone is actually called an 'anonymous callback' or maybe a 'click handler')

    // usually, we do 3 things here:
        // 1) get some information
        // 2) use that information to update state
        // 3) update the DOM to reflect these state changes
})
```

## Making a plan

If you haven't gotten yourself into a mess yet, you won't believe me, but: planning is more important than coding.

Without a plan, it is all to easy to "try to do everything at once", or try to "make a sloppy copy" or "rough draft". 

The Golden Rule:  ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

When you've made a big enough mess, don't be surprised if me or a TA advises you to trash the repo and start over. 
    - We're not trying to be mean: we've all thrown out dozens of apps we've sunk hours into! 
    - It's sometimes just literally easier to start a project over than miserably debug a project where 'nothing works'.

So here's how to work toward avoiding that situation:

1) Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"
1) Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision
1) For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this? 
1) Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"
    - for example, if we know we need to inject words into a div, note `div.textContent = 'my new words'`
1) Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. 
    - Does any state change? 
    - Does any DOM change? (if state changes, the answer is yes üôÇ)
1) Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done
    - 90% of the time, it's just "`console.log` something" to make sure it's right.
1) Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.
